## Problem Description

## Dataset
* [Kaggle Heart Failure Prediction Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/heart-failure-prediction/)

## EDA
* Refer Jupyter Notebook.

## Model training
* Refer Jupyter Notebook.

## Exporting notebook to script

## Model deployment

## Dependency and environment management
### [Optional] Create New Conda Virtual Environment 
* `conda create -n ml-midterm-env` then `conda activate ml-midterm-env`
* `conda install pip`

### Create Virtual Environment using Pipenv
* Make sure you have pipenv in your existing environment, if not, first execute `pip install pipenv`.
* If you already installed pipenv, execute `pipenv install numpy scikit-learn seaborn jupyter notebook xgboost tqdm`.
* If it's successful, you should see both `Pipfile` and `Pipfile.lock`.

### Activate virtual env
* To use the pipenv environment created from previous section , navigate to the project folder which contains `Pipfile` and `Pipfile.lock`, then execute `pipenv shell`.
* Execute the following commands after `pipenv shell` for:
    * Open Jupyter Notebook: `jupyter notebook`
